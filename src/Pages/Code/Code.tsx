					<h3>Play What</h3>

					<p>
						Play What is a React component library I developed for visualizing music theory concepts.
						It provides a simple API for configuring viewer components and creating your own.
					</p>

					<p>
						Examples and interactive documentation can be found on the <a href='https://dan9418.github.io/play-what-sample/' target='_blank'>project site</a>.

					<h3>Portfolio Site</h3>
					<p>
						I have maintained a personal site since 2013.
						I use this site as a sandbox to learn new technologies and keep a portfolio of my projects.
						It is currently powered by React, TypeScript, and pure CSS.

					<h3>Augmented Reality Dashboard</h3>
					<p>
						I developed an
						<span className='italic'> augmented reality dashboard </span>
						Android app for my senior design project at Pitt.
						It was sponsored by
						<a className='code-link' href='https://www.eaton.com' target='_blank'>Eaton</a>
						and won 2nd place at my department's design expo.
					</p>

					<p>
						The app used an AR library to recognize mock electrical switchgear and retrieve its data over a wifi network.

					<h3>Boolean Algebra Calculator</h3>

					<p>
						My first mobile project was an Android application for solving boolean expressions.
						It's not available on the app store anymore, but I plan to modernize it and convert it to a web app someday.
